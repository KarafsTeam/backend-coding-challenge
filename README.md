### TODO:

- add health check
- using `forwardRef` is not a good practice, we just used it for sake of simplicity

Welcome to the Karafs backend coding challenge repository! This challenge is designed to evaluate your skills in building robust, scalable, and maintainable backend systems using NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Kafka.

## Challenge Overview

The task involves building a backend service for a health tracker application with the following core features:

1.  Authentication and Authorization:
    - Implement JWT-based authentication.
    - Role-based access control (e.g., Admin and User roles).
2.  Water Intake Tracker:
    - Users can log their daily water intake.
    - Each user has a daily water goal.
    - Increment a streak when the goal is achieved (once per day).
3.  Movement Tracker:
    - Users must first activate location tracking through an API endpoint before the system starts accepting their GPS data.
    - Users periodically send their GPS location to the backend.
    - GPS data should be published to Kafka.
    - Calculate the total distance traveled per hour using this data.
4.  Admin Dashboard Endpoints:
    - Admins can view all user data, including water intake, streaks, and movement statistics.

## Technical Requirements

- Framework: NestJS with TypeScript.
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose.
- Message Broker: Kafka for handling GPS data.
- Containerization: Dockerize the application for seamless deployment.
- Testing: Write unit tests for core functionalities.
- Documentation: Use Swagger (OpenAPI) for API documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Docker
- Kafka
- MongoDB

## Submission Guidelines

1.  Complete the task as described above.
2.  Push your code to your GitHub repository.
3.  Submit your solution as a pull request to this repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- Code Quality: Clean, modular, and follows best practices.
- Functionality: Meets all requirements.
- Testing: Comprehensive unit tests.
- Documentation: Clear and detailed.
- Performance: Efficient and scalable implementation.
