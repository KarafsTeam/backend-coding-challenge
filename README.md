### Features

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different roles (Admin, User) with specific permissions.
- **Water Intake Tracker**: Log daily water intake and track streaks.
- **Movement Tracker**: Track user movements and calculate distance traveled.
- **Kafka Integration**: Use Kafka for handling GPS data.
- **Swagger**: API documentation with Swagger (OpenAPI).
- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Containerization for seamless deployment.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with `nestjs-pino`.

### Notes

- It's better to not use `:latest` tag for Docker images in production.
- Store valid refresh tokens in a key-value database like Redis.
- RabbitMQ is more fit for asynchronous load balancing, and Kafka suffers from head-of-line blocking for partitions.
- Using `forwardRef` is not a good practice; it was used here for simplicity.
- Please read TODO: in the codebase.

### TODO:

**Pending improvements:**

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
- Implement comprehensive E2E and unit tests.
- Optimize database queries and indexing.
- Add more detailed logging and monitoring.

**Note**: The implementation focuses on core functionalities to ensure timely delivery. Advanced configurations, optimizations, and additional features can be added in future iterations.

Welcome to the Karafs backend coding challenge repository! This challenge is designed to evaluate your skills in building robust, scalable, and maintainable backend systems using NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Kafka.

## Challenge Overview

The task involves building a backend service for a health tracker application with the following core features:

1.  Authentication and Authorization:
    - Implement JWT-based authentication.
    - Role-based access control (e.g., Admin and User roles).
2.  Water Intake Tracker:
    - Users can log their daily water intake.
    - Each user has a daily water goal.
    - Increment a streak when the goal is achieved (once per day).
3.  Movement Tracker:
    - Users must first activate location tracking through an API endpoint before the system starts accepting their GPS data.
    - Users periodically send their GPS location to the backend.
    - GPS data should be published to Kafka.
    - Calculate the total distance traveled per hour using this data.
4.  Admin Dashboard Endpoints:
    - Admins can view all user data, including water intake, streaks, and movement statistics.

## Technical Requirements

- Framework: NestJS with TypeScript.
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose.
- Message Broker: Kafka for handling GPS data.
- Containerization: Dockerize the application for seamless deployment.
- Testing: Write unit tests for core functionalities.
- Documentation: Use Swagger (OpenAPI) for API documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Docker
- Kafka
- MongoDB

## Submission Guidelines

1.  Complete the task as described above.
2.  Push your code to your GitHub repository.
3.  Submit your solution as a pull request to this repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- Code Quality: Clean, modular, and follows best practices.
- Functionality: Meets all requirements.
- Testing: Comprehensive unit tests.
- Documentation: Clear and detailed.
- Performance: Efficient and scalable implementation.
