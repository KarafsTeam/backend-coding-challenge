Welcome to the Karafs backend coding challenge repository! This challenge is designed to evaluate your skills in building robust, scalable, and maintainable backend systems using NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Kafka.

### Challenge Overview

The task involves building a backend service for a health tracker application with the following core features:
	1.	Authentication and Authorization:
    	â€¢	Implement JWT-based authentication.
    	â€¢	Role-based access control (e.g., Admin and User roles).
	2.	Water Intake Tracker:
      â€¢	Users can log their daily water intake.
      â€¢	Each user has a daily water goal.
      â€¢	Increment a streak when the goal is achieved (once per day).
	3.	Movement Tracker:
      â€¢	Users must first activate location tracking through an API endpoint before the system starts accepting their GPS data.
      â€¢	Users periodically send their GPS location to the backend.
      â€¢	GPS data should be published to Kafka.
      â€¢	Calculate the total distance traveled per hour using this data.
	4.	Admin Dashboard Endpoints:
	    â€¢	Admins can view all user data, including water intake, streaks, and movement statistics.

Technical Requirements
	â€¢	Framework: NestJS with TypeScript.
	â€¢	Database: MongoDB with Mongoose.
	â€¢	Message Broker: Kafka for handling GPS data.
	â€¢	Containerization: Dockerize the application for seamless deployment.
	â€¢	Testing: Write unit tests for core functionalities.
	â€¢	Documentation: Use Swagger (OpenAPI) for API documentation.

Prerequisites
	â€¢	Node.js (v18+)
	â€¢	Docker
	â€¢	Kafka
	â€¢	MongoDB

Submission Guidelines
	1.	Complete the task as described above.
	2.	Push your code to your GitHub repository.
	3.	Submit your solution as a pull request to this repository.


### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:
	â€¢	Code Quality: Clean, modular, and follows best practices.
	â€¢	Functionality: Meets all requirements.
	â€¢	Testing: Comprehensive unit tests.
	â€¢	Documentation: Clear and detailed.
	â€¢	Performance: Efficient and scalable implementation.
